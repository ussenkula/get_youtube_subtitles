the video said this dog can't stop
smiling and wants to be adopted so bad
i was like oh my god this dog is so
precious i'm coming home with this dog
tomorrow
i walked in and i was like can i see the
smiling dog oh my gosh she's so cute
she's so tiny
her eyes are so light and it's just so
pretty
she like immediately would burn her head
in the nook of her neck
heart building they found her on one of
the main highways over here they said
she was close to being hit
we were the first ones to come here
so i took it as a sign that we should
adopt her
[Music]
she just walked right up to lady and
just bit her collar and was kind of like
come with me and play with me
sadie like a walking cotton ball
literally the first two days she acted
like she didn't exist
[Music]
brutus took a long time to warm up to
her i guess he's not used to any other
dogs trying to get in his bed because
he's the biggest dog
[Music]
i just couldn't tell when we picked her
up that she would fit in perfectly it
was meant to be
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
it's all of ladies toys
[Music]
she makes the funniest noises she grunts
[Music]
she's real clumsy right now
[Music]
she was young she'd never been around
stairs
[Music]
good girl
good girl
[Music]
competitor and kissed her and she's so
cute
i get whole and she jumps up and she'll
stretch up all the way you can really
see the smile like big time when she's
looking up at you it looks like she's
just so happy
we are suckers for cute little animals
that need help
they're so sweet they just love
unconditionally they're so innocent
